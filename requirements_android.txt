# Note: tflite-runtime is platform specific. Flet generic build usually handles it via p4a recipes if specified.
# For simplicity in GitHub Actions, we often rely on standard packages or specific wheels.
# But for now, we list it. If standard build fails, we might need just 'flet' and allow flet to manage python.
